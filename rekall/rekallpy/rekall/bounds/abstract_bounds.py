from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Bounds(ABC):
    """
    The ``Bounds`` class is a simple wrapper around a dictionary. Typically,
    the keys in this dictionary should represent physical bounds, like ``t1``,
    ``t2`` for time or ``x1``, ``x2`` for space.

    Each class that inherits from ``Bounds`` should define a ``data`` dict upon
    initialization. This allows fields from the bounds to be referenced using
    ``[]`` notation.

    Each child class should also implement the following methods:
    
    ``__lt__`` for sorting

    ``__repr__`` for printing

    ``primary_axis`` to specify a tuple representing the major axis for
    optimization. For videos, the primary  will typically be ``('t1', 't2')``.

    ``copy`` for producing a copy of this Bounds

    The ``Bounds`` class comes with a ``combine`` method that takes two Bounds
    instances and a combiner function and combines them into one Bounds.
    Child classes may want to implement common combination functions or provide
    mechanisms to use different combination functions across multiple axes.

    The ``Bounds`` class also provides a ``cast`` mechanism to recast
    predicates to use other dimensions. The ``cast`` mechanism takes in a
    function that expects one or more ``dict``-like objects as input and remaps
    keys of the input.

    Example:
        Let's define a simple function that prints the 't' field of an object::

            def print_t(obj):
                print(obj['t'])

        Now suppose we have an object with a key of 'x' instead::

            my_obj = { 'x': 1 }

        Then we can cast ``print_t`` to print out the 'x' field instead of the
        't' field::

            >>> cast({'t': 'x'})(print_t)(my_obj)
            1
    
    See the example below for a full example of a Bounds class.

    Example:
        The example below defines a two-dimensional Bounds object with two
        dimensions, defined by ``t1``, ``t2``, ``x1``, and ``x2``::

            from rekall.predicates import overlaps

            class Bounds2D(Bounds):
                def __init__(self, t1, t2, x1, x2):
                    self.data = { 't1': t1, 't2': t2, 'x1': x1, 'x2': x2 }

                def __lt__(self, other):
                    return ((self['t1'], self['t2'], self['x1'], self['x2']) <
                            (other['t1'], other['t2'], other['x1'], other['x2']))

                def __repr__(self):
                    return 't1:{} t2:{} x1:{} x2:{}'.format(
                        self['t1'], self['t2'], self['x1'], self['x2'])

                def primary_axis(self):
                    return ('t1', 't2')

                def T(pred):
                    return cast({ 't1': 'x1', 't2': 'x2' })(pred)

            bounds1 = Bounds2D(0, 1, 0.5, 0.7)
            bounds2 = Bounds2D(2, 3, 0.4, 0.6)

            # overlaps expects two objects with fields 't1' and 't2' and
            #   computes whether there is overlap in that dimension

            # This is False, since there is no time overlap
            overlaps()(bounds1, bounds2)

            # This is True, since there is overlap in the X dimension
            Bounds2D.X(overlaps())(bounds1, bounds2)

            # This is True.
            bounds1 < bounds2
